		<h2>10 Tips To Keep Your Dog Cool(er) This Summer</h2>
		<div style="width:50%">
		<ol>
			<li>Obviously, the number one rule is to keep your dog hydrated with water.  It’s a no brainer, but we had to say it. On road trips stop regularly to make sure your pet has enough water. And make sure it’s clean – some dogs won’t drink something that’s been stagnant for long.</li>
			<li>We never recommend leaving your dog inside the car without proper airflow during the summer months. Even in the shade a car can be 10, 20, even 30 degrees hotter than it is outside.</li>
			<li>If you’re leaving your dog outside, always make sure you provide shade for your dog, and show your dog where his/her (non-glass) water bowl is in that shade. Please don’t tie your dog up anywhere in the blazing sun.</li>
			<li>There was information flying around a few years ago that ice is bad for your dog. Not true. Adding a few cubes (being mindful of the size) only helps cool your pet down. On road trips, a couple frozen water bottles in the crate isn’t a bad idea either.</li>
			<li>Applying rubbing alcohol on your dog's pads is said to help bring their temperature down. It cools as it evaporates, acting as a body cooling agent. Ice packs under the armpits also works.</li>
			<li>Exercise your dog in the early morning or evening hours. Dogs cool off primarily through panting, not perspiring, so it takes longer to bring their temperature down than it does yours.</li>
			<li>If your dog has the capability to swim, it’s the best way to exercise in the heat.</li>
			<li>Watch out for hot pavement. In the summer months, it can badly burn your dog's paw pads, and it’s a heightened source of heat. If you can’t leave your bare foot on the asphalt for longer than 10 seconds, consider taking the dog out when it’s cooler.</li>
			<li>Check with your trainer or your vet before shaving your dog. If your dog spends a lot of time outdoors, cutting their coat down may be worth it. But coats can also offer a barrier between biting bugs, mosquitos and the sun – plus the undercoat of double-coated dogs actually helps with airflow across their skin. That’s why keeping your dog groomed and unmatted can help its natural cooling system.</li>
			<li>Finally, monitor your dog's’ temperature if you are worried. A good rule of thumb when measuring your dog's temperature is that it shouldn’t be allowed to get over 104 degrees.
